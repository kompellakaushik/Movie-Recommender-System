# Movie-Recommender-System
Led a team of 3 to develop and analyze a recommender system based on a data set consisting of over 100,000 ratings from around 1000 users and 1700 movies. 
Evaluated the performance using collaborative filtering algorithms like Matrix Factorization to predict ratings. Movies with high ratings were recommended to a user. 
Reduced RMSE by 22% compared to the state of the art. Tool used: RapidMiner.
